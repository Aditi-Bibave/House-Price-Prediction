# 🏠 House Price Prediction Model

A machine learning project that predicts house prices using regression models based on historical housing data.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to estimate house prices by analyzing multiple property-related features. The goal is to understand key factors affecting house prices and evaluate the performance of different regression models.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Used a housing dataset containing **10,000+ records** with **15+ features**
- Features include income, house age, number of rooms, occupancy, and location-based attributes
- Target variable: **House Price**

## Workflow
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and missing value handling
- Categorical feature encoding
- Train-test split
- Model training using:
  - Linear Regression
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Model evaluation using regression metrics
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

## Results
- Compared baseline and advanced regression models
- XGBoost provided better performance than linear regression
- Identified key features influencing house price predictions
